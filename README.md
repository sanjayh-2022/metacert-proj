# MetaCert

An application for securely issuing, storing, and verifying tamper-proof digital credentials. By leveraging IPFS and Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), MetaCert ensures trust and authenticity empowering users to manage credentials with unmatched security and transparency.


## Features

- üîí **Secure Credential Issuance**: Issue cryptographically secured credentials.  
- üåê **IPFS Storage**: Store credentials in a decentralized, immutable manner.
